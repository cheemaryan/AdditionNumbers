# AdditionNumbers

This app was coded on Android Studio using the Android Java SDK.8U73, and was shared on Github using the VCS option.  The purpose of this simple Android app is to add two numbers of ant string length. It is the third app that I made, I was experimenting on Android Studio for fun for one night, and came up with this app in a matter of a few hours. During my time with Android SDK and Java, I have been honing my skills and becoming an efficient coder by frequenting various books and courses online; namely CodeAcademy and theNewBoston.
